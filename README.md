# Robot-Class-Final

## Problem Statement
We've learned many cool models in class that allows robots to perform tasks at a given location. However, most of these robots are doing predefined/pretrained tasks at close proximity to the objects of interest. This is different from the ideal state of intelligent robots where the robot need to take instructions from human, and move toward the objective where the object of interest is located. For example, if we want our home robot to do laundry, it has to move toward the washing machine from whereever it was beforehand. 

Therefore, for our final project, we developed a rover that would take any instruction from human users, then search and move toward the object specified in the prompt.
